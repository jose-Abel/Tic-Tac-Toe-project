## Getting Started
You can clone this code anytime and run it with the Ruby interpreter in the Windows console or Unix terminal or it can run in Unix OS by typing ./main.rb in the terminal since it has the shebang at the top to make it an executable file.


### Setup
You can either copy the code with git clone or with any other method and run it on your local environment.


### Run tests
I run the tests for the linters.yml and rubocop and everything pass!
