# Tic Tac Toe

The Microverse third project for the Ruby module that consists of creating a Tic Tac Toe game in the console by following 4 different stages or milestones for the overall implementation, each milestone has to have it's own git branch, and this branch consist in the 3rd milestone where the game logic is created and the codebase is completely change to an OOP programming paradigm.

For the OOP implementation 2 classes and 1 module were created grouping together all the methods that belong to each class and the module. The files are:

- The Player class that initializes with 4 attributes, the strings name and mark, the array moves and the boolean has_won, the strings name and mark are parameters for the initialize method. This class also has 1 public method called winning_moves and 11 private methods. The public method launch 3 private getter methods in charge of launching the other methods that verified just 1 set of winning moves in order to maintain DRY principles in the overall structure of the program.

- The Board class that initializes a variable named positions that contains the hash for the key-value pairs of the board. It also has the public methods move_in_board in charge of adding the "X" or "O" mark value, depending on the player, to its respective key in the board. If the position has already been chosen or does not exist in the board this method does some validation on that and called the get_user_input methods located in main again so that the user can try with a different choice. The Board class also has the methods hash_has_blank to determine if the board has any key without any value and as soon as there isn't any key with an empty value the game stops. Finally, it has the paint_canvas method in charge of displaying the board with the user's marks, either 'X' or 'O', in its respective key.

- The HelperMethods module, with the 2 methods name_not_empty as the name implies it makes sure that the name field at the beginning is not left empty by either of the players and the repeated_name method in charge of making sure the second player doesn't choose the same name as the first.

- The main file is where everything happens, it has the main method where the board and the players are initialized, the players passing the name as elements in the array, that calls the choice_your_player method located in the same file, and the mark as 'X' or 'O'. The main file is also responsible for the core while loop that will keep running until either one of the players has_won property is set to true or the board hash_has_blank method returns false. The main file has the methods intro where the initial instructions are provided to the players, passing the board as argument to launch the paint_canvas method with the instructions in order to display the board at the beggining, it has the choose_your_player method that with 2 while loops repeats the same code for the 2 players in order to get their names and do validation that the name field is not left empty and that the second player doesn't choose the same name as the first. It also has the choosing_player method that extract some logic from the choose_your_player method in accordance with DRY principles. The main file also has the get_user_input method were, passing the player and the board arguments, is in charge of calling the move_in_board method for the board class on the board instance object. Lastly, it has 2 methods, puts_message and print_message, each of which takes a string as a parameter and the only thing they do is launch either a puts or a prints command respectively, this is so that all the puts and prints commands are located in the main file.

## Built With

## Getting Started
You can clone this code anytime and run it with the Ruby interpreter in the Windows console or Unix terminal or it can run in Unix OS by typing bin/main.rb in the terminal since the main file has the shebang at the top to make it an executable file.


### Setup
You can either copy the code with git clone or with any other method and run it on your local environment.


### Run tests
I run the tests for the linters.yml and rubocop and everything pass!


### Acknowledgments
Appreciate the Ruby Team, and a special acknowledgment to Microverse for pushing us further into accomplishing our goals.
