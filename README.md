# Tic Tac Toe game in the console

The Microverse third project for the Ruby module that consists of creating a Tic Tac Toe game in the console by following 4 different stages or milestones for the overall implementation, each milestone has to have it's own git branch, and this branch consist in the 3rd milestone where the game logic is created and the codebase is completely change to an OOP programming paradigm.

For the OOP implementation 2 classes and 1 module were created grouping together all the methods that belong to each class and the module. The files are:

- The Player class that initializes with 4 attributes, the strings name and mark, the array moves and the boolean has_won, the strings name and mark are parameters for the initialize method. This class also has 1 public method called winning_moves and 11 private methods. The public method launch 3 private getter methods in charge of launching the other methods that verified just 1 set of winning moves in order to maintain DRY principles in the overall structure of the program.

- The Board class that initializes a variable named positions that contains the hash for the key-value pairs of the board. It also has the public methods move_in_board in charge of adding the "X" or "O" mark value, depending on the player, to its respective key in the board. If the position has already been chosen or does not exist in the board this method does some validation on that and called the get_user_input methods located in main again so that the user can try with a different choice. The Board class also has the methods hash_has_blank to determine if the board has any key without any value and as soon as there isn't any key with an empty value the game stops. Finally, it has the paint_canvas method in charge of displaying the board with the user's marks, either 'X' or 'O', in its respective key.

- The HelperMethods module with 3 methods, name_not_empty as the name implies it makes sure that the name field at the beginning is not left empty by either of the players, the repeated_name method in charge of making sure the second player doesn't choose the same name as the first and the name_not_number method to make sure neither of the player choose a number as a name.

- The main file has the main method where the board and the players are initialized, the players passing the name as elements in the array, that calls the choice_your_player method located in the same file, and the mark as 'X' or 'O'. The main file is also responsible for the core while loop that will keep running until either one of the players has_won property is set to true or the board hash_has_blank method returns false. The main file has the methods intro where the initial instructions are provided to the players, passing the board as argument to launch the paint_canvas method with the instructions in order to display the board at the beggining, it has the choose_your_player method with 2 while loops and 1 until loops repeats the same code for the 2 players in order to get their names and do validation, makes sure the name field is not left empty, also validate the second player doesn't choose the same name as the first and neither of the players choose a number as a name. It also has the choosing_player method that extract some logic from the choose_your_player method in accordance with DRY principles. The main file also has the get_user_input method were, passing the player and the board arguments, is in charge of calling the move_in_board method for the board class on the board instance object. The main file has 3 methods, puts_message, print_message and gets_chomp, each of which launch either a puts, a prints or a gets.chomp command respectively, this is so that all the put, prints and gets.chomp commands are located in the main file. Lastly, it has the restarting_game method which ask if the players wants to restart the game with the options 'yes' or 'y' if choosen it will repeat the main function restarting the whole while loop and the game logic, 'no' or 'n' if choosen will end the programm and the else condition in charge of repeating the same restarting function since either a 'yes' 'y' or 'no' 'n' answer has to be provided.

## Built With
- Ruby programming language

## Author

- üë§GitHub: [Jose Abel Ramirez](https://github.com/jose-Abel)
- Linkedin: [Jose Abel Ramirez Frontany](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-abel-ramirez-frontany-7674a842/)

## Getting Started
You can clone this code anytime and run it with the Ruby interpreter in the Windows console or Unix terminal by typing 'ruby bin/main.rb' or it can run in Unix OS by typing 'bin/main.rb' in the terminal, without the 'ruby' interpreter command, since the main file has the shebang instruction at the top that makes it an executable file.

### Setup
You can either copy the code with git clone or with any other method and run it on your local environment. The commands to clone it and then run the game are:
- git clone https://github.com/jose-Abel/Tic-Tac-Toe-project.git
- cd Tic-Tac-Toe-project
- bin/main.rb (if you are in Linux or Mac)
- ruby bin/main.rb (for Windows)

### Run tests
Run the tests for the linters.yml and rubocop and everything pass. The instructions to setup this tests are at this repository: [Rubocop instructions](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/ruby)

For the linters, this tests runs once you make a PR, if you have it in the respective folder. In order to have this tests, after cloning this project:
 - cd Tic-Tac-Toe-project
- From the root of this project create the folders .github/workflows
- Add a copy of [.github/workflows/tests.yml](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/ruby/.github/workflows/tests.yml) to the .github/workflows

To download rubocop and run the tests on your local environment, this are the commands to type in the Linux, Mac terminal or Windows cmd:
- gem 'rubocop'
- cd Tic-Tac-Toe-project
- copy this file [.rubocop.yml](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/ruby/.rubocop.yml) in the root directory of the project
- type in the terminal 'rubocop'
